# Commit 1 - Research

#  Answer the research questions below
  # 1. What happens when you make a method with no parameters then pass in an argument?

    # Unexpected number of arguments error(expect 0 got 1)

  # 2. What happens when you have a method that defines three parameters and you give it only 2 arguments when it is called?

    # Unexpected number of arguments error(expected 3 got 2)
    # 

  # 3. What are the errors you get?

    # 

  # 4. Can you get an error by adding or subtracting arguments when using the example code? If so, what errors do you get?

    # 

  # 5. What happens when you add more parameters before the splat parameter? Or after the splat parameter?

    #  

# Commit 2 - Pseudocode

# input: an array of integers
# output: a letter grade based on the mean of the grades

# Steps
# 1 - Take in a series of numbers
# 2 - Find the average of those numbers
# 3 - Give a letter grade based on that average

# Commit 3 - Initial Solution

def calculate_letter_grade()
  # write code here  
end

# Commit 5 - Refactor Solution



# Commit 4 - Write Runner Code / Tests
